4. What are the main tasks of data mining?

➡ Classification, Clustering, Association, Regression, and Prediction.


---

5. What is the difference between classification and clustering?

➡

Classification: Supervised learning (uses labeled data).

Clustering: Unsupervised learning (no labels).



---

6. What is supervised learning?

➡ Learning from labeled data where the output class is known.


---

7. What is unsupervised learning?

➡ Learning patterns or structures from data where no labels are given.


---

8. What is the Decision Tree?

➡ A tree-like model used for classification or prediction by splitting data based on attributes.


---

9. What is the J48 algorithm?

➡ J48 is WEKA’s version of the C4.5 decision tree algorithm used for classification.


---

10. What is the ID3 algorithm?

➡ ID3 builds a decision tree using Information Gain to choose the best attribute for splitting.


---

11. What is Information Gain?

➡ It measures how much an attribute reduces the uncertainty (entropy) about the target class.


---

12. What is Entropy?

➡ Entropy measures the impurity or randomness in the data.


---

13. What is k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)?

➡ A simple algorithm that classifies a new instance based on the majority class of its k nearest data points.


---

14. What is Naive Bayes?

➡ A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem assuming attributes are independent.


---

15. What is Clustering?

➡ Grouping similar data points into clusters without using predefined labels.


---

16. What is k-Means algorithm?

➡ It divides data into k clusters based on distance to the cluster centroids.


---

17. What is the Apriori algorithm?

➡ An association rule mining algorithm that finds frequent itemsets using support and confidence.


---

18. What is the FP-Growth algorithm?

➡ A faster method than Apriori that uses a tree structure (FP-tree) to find frequent patterns.


---

19. What are Support and Confidence?

➡

Support: Frequency of an itemset in the dataset.

Confidence: Likelihood that rule “A → B” is true.



---

20. What is Feature Selection?

➡ Choosing the most relevant attributes to improve model performance and reduce computation.


---

21. What is Data Preprocessing?

➡ Cleaning and transforming raw data before applying machine learning algorithms.


---

22. What is Normalization?

➡ Scaling data values to a specific range (usually 0–1).


---

23. What is Standardization?

➡ Rescaling data so that it has mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.


---

24. What is Discretization?

➡ Converting continuous (numeric) data into discrete categories or intervals.


---

25. What is Missing Value Treatment?

➡ Replacing missing data with mean, median, or mode values.


---

26. What is the use of WEKA tool?

➡ WEKA is used for data preprocessing, classification, clustering, association rule mining, and visualization.


---

27. What is the difference between training and testing data?

➡

Training data: Used to build the model.

Testing data: Used to check the accuracy of the model.



---

28. What is Cross-Validation?

➡ A method to test model performance by dividing data into k folds (usually 10) for fair evaluation.


---

29. What is Accuracy?

➡ The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.


---

30. What is Precision and Recall?

➡

Precision: Correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions.

Recall: Correct positive predictions out of all actual positives.



---

31. What is a Neural Network?

➡ A computational model inspired by the human brain that learns patterns through neurons and weights.


---

32. What is Backpropagation?

➡ The learning algorithm in neural networks that adjusts weights to minimize error.


---

33. What is the main advantage of Decision Trees?

➡ Easy to understand and interpret; handles both numeric and categorical data.


---

34. What are Association Rules?

➡ Rules that show relationships between items in a transaction (e.g., “If Milk and Bread → Butter”).


---

35. What is a Cluster Centroid?

➡ The mean position of all the data points in a cluster.


---

36. What is the main difference between Apriori and FP-Growth?

➡ Apriori generates candidate sets; FP-Growth builds a tree structure — thus faster and memory efficient.


---

37. What is a Confusion Matrix?

➡ A table showing correct and incorrect predictions for each class.


---

38. What is Overfitting?

➡ When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.


---

39. What is Underfitting?

➡ When a model is too simple and cannot capture data patterns properly.


---
